## Analysis Steps

This solution I needed to create an arraylist and then sort it.
I would have to use the method that i used to sort the array and then sort it
to test to see if the sort method worked.

### Design

I first used the Generic class ArrayList to create an array. 
I next created a for loop to fill the array list with numbers up to 10.
I then created a method to shuffle the array.
I then created a method to sort the array

### Testing

after creating the array list and the for loop to fill it,
I printed out the list to see if it filled up the list with numbers.
worked.

I then created a method to shuffle the array list.
inside the method I created a for loop set to the array list size. 
inside this for loop I created a temp place holder for the numbers in the array list.
then set the number in the array list. 
this repeated until the array was filled.
I then ran the method to make sure the array was shuffled.

After the shuffle was displayed I created a method to sort the array
I used for loops and if statements to compare the two numbers.
if the first number was smaller than the second number, the loop would continue.
if the first number was larger than the second number, the if statement would switch the numbers.
this will go on until the array was sorted smallest to largest.
